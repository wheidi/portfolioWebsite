            <h2>How to iterate quickly with teammates</h2>
            <p>With our users being teammates within the same office, it was a lot easier to collaborate with them. 
                However I still needed to be mindful about using their time intentionally. Thus, opportunities to design more efficiently included being able to use lo-fi designs to iterate,
                and being able to job shadow easily. Identifying these opportunities helped me design a solution more quickly, and also build buy-in as the team was very involved in the process.

            <h2>Handling changes mid-design</h2>

            <p>The flow for a key action was changed mid-way through the project. Despite that, What helped this transition go smoothly
                without adding too much time to the project was the swift communication with the manager on exactly what was changed. During this conversation, I asked questions to clarify exactly
                what was changed and what wasn't. From there, in conjunction with the information-hierarchy work we did earlier, I was able to easily adjust the changed flow without having to change 
                any other part of the design.
