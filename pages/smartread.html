<div class="section grey" id="summary">
<p class="textcontent">This was my very first UI/UX design project. As a team of 5, we identified a problem, and did our best to address it. Misinformation on the internet is not an unfamiliar issue, seeming to affect all audiences from all walks of life. It comes in the form of strange "beauty hacks" with trivial repercussions, to affecting large communities of individuals and even playing a hand in others' health and well-being. The reaches of misinformation, or, "Fake News" is far and wide, and thus, here is our attempt at addressing it.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/189c21364cc4ed2cebe24e6cc3e56853/e8ef0ddae72823d5-2f/s500x750/eaaf56a8f87ecc135e7486488531d5c3793a3c07.png" /></p>
<p>There are an abundance of articles and information sources online. How do we know the validity of these sources - how do we know if we&rsquo;ve encountered &ldquo;Fake News&rdquo;?&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section grey">
<h1>Empathize</h1>
<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f9633b16b94b1ec756d9d485dee3794/e8ef0ddae72823d5-07/s1280x1920/f31946291b4f1fc3991777cb416ece5324f53feb.png" /></p>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>In a series of online surveys, in-person interviews, and participant observation field studies all totaling over 250 participants, we came to a number of notable points.</p>
<div>
<ul class="center">
    <p><span class="bold">89%</span> of participants have been a victim of Fake News
    <p><span class="bold">68%</span> of participants use Social Media on their Mobile Devices
    <p><span class="bold">57%</span> Use Social Media to consume news articles
</ul>
<p>The message was clear, the problem we proposed is very real, and potentially effects a majority of Social Media users.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1>Define</h1>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>Next, we moved on to defining and planning our collected information to better understand the needs of our users and how we might address them. This was done in the form of User Personas, User Journeys, and Affinity Diagrams.</p>
</div>
<div class="textcontent">
<h2 class="bold">User Persona</h2>
</div>
<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/297a26c2cd8365568c2f80646b1cb444/d4cb7d46f140a300-50/s1280x1920/0e946ca776be36fc7eb82234e202cf3098741a10.png" /></p>

<div class="section grey">
<h1>Prototype + Test</h1>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>Now that we have our information, we created paper prototypes to further test and iterate on our designs. Simply watching users achieve designated tasks while vocalizing their thoughts and expectations was very insightful in showing us where to improve or change our designs.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="bold">Paper Prototypes</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/24923cf925c375de49a0755f85d2030b/e8ef0ddae72823d5-fc/s1280x1920/b40620835ece892734aaaef0205c824cd9f1f253.png" /></p>

<div class="textcontent">
<h2 class="bold">Iterations</h2>

<p>One critical feedback we got was that the score breakdown of an article was hard to digest - "Why did an article have a credibility score of 82%?"</p>
<p>The user should be able to understand and answer this question easily, however this was not the case. To fix this, we invoked Progressive Disclosure in the form of drop down menus to further help them gradually understand larger chunks of information.</p>
</div>
<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/52a6a69b306a2faa81755c2be97ce6f9/e8ef0ddae72823d5-a1/s1280x1920/d9733bbc4a94b25249c7278783ace17c48202a2e.png"/></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Final Product</h1>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>After two UX workshops and numerous iterations, we were able to arrive at our final solution, an app that evaluates article credibility, while the user is scrolling through their social media.</p>
</div>

<div class="tablepost">
<div><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa5e2fb4f56b6eacc610ce3bebafa3/e8ef0ddae72823d5-76/s400x600/cc537f0f12fa496e8afe158f9e0f20e2c8ab8aa1.gifv" /></div>
<div class="lcolumn">
<h2 class="bold">Second Nature Behaviour</h2>
<p class="bold">Intention</p>
<p>We want our intervention to be easily adoptable into any users' usual behaviour when reading articles. Checking an article's credibility should be second nature, and coupled with the behaviour of reading the article itself.</p>
<p class="bold">Solution</p>
<p>Our main point of access is a notification that appears at the top of the screen. This allowed us to take advantage of a number of benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver a single credibility score intially, allowing users to easily and quickly understand the article's credibility at a glance.</li>
<li>The user receives our service without having to learn any new behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="tablepost">

<div class="rcolumn">
<h2 class="bold">Encourage Curiousity</h2>
<p class="bold">Intention</p>
<p>We want to promote curiosity and critical thinking in our users. What if the user wanted to know more? What if they wanted to consult a more credible source?</p>
<p class="bold">Solution</p>
<p>Let them! We captured the most effective next steps and desired information, based on our user research, in an expandable notification.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having it in a notification captures the easy access benefits mentioned previously.</li>
<li>The user has options to find more information or pursue more credible sources without having to leave the current page they're on.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="lcolumn">
<h2 class="bold">Empower and Educate</h2>
<p class="bold">Intention</p>
<p>We want to help users make informed decisions and critically think about their sources of information. As such, we want to give our users every opportunity to learn about our process and how to evaluate the credibility of articles for themselves.</p>
<p class="bold">Solution</p>
<p>Transparency and clear information delivery is key! By telling them exactly how we calculate our scores, we can achieve this. To deliver this information, we used progressive disclosure in terms of drop down menus, and colour coded percentages as well as clearly labelled titles to convey information</p>
<ul>
<li>Having drop down options allows users to learn information gradually, without being overwhelmed from the get-go</li>
<li>Coloured indicators of "good" scores (green) to "sub-par" scores(yellow) allow us to convey a higher quality of information as opposed to a generic percentage score.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>My first UI/UX project ended just like that - with a presentation in front of our class plus some design experts from IBM (There also happened to be a competition where we won second place üòâ‚ú®) . This project opened my eyes to the UX/UI industry, and not only introduced me to many industry practices and guidelines, but also opened my eyes to the role of UX/UI design in our everyday lives. I'm writing this reflection a year after this project, and even now I'm continually conscious and asking myself about the UX design of everyday items. I recently played a board game and was blown away by how a completely new game was so easy to pickup.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2 class="bold">What I Learned</h2>

<h5>The design of information presentation.</h5>
<p>We had a lot of information we wanted to present to our users. Yet how we communicated this information was as crucial as the information itself. Using <span class="bold">progressive disclosure</span> in terms of drop down menus and links, as well as utilizing <span class="bold">visual hierarchies</span> in our typography was crucial to making information more digestable.</p>
<br />
<h5>Next time</h5>
<p>Next time, to build on this principle, I believe we could utilize well-known icons as well, and explore other options to group the information presented in a way that makes more sense. This could further help users find desired information and reduce cognitive load as well.</p>
