    <h2>What is Fake News?</h2>

    <p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="images/SmartRead/User research quotes.png" /></p>

    <p>We’re exposed to an abundance of news articles, written pieces, and other information sources on social media. How do we know the validity of these sources - are they backed by research,
        or spreading misinformation? </p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>Within a group of 5, I conducted in person interviews, contributed to both
        lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes, held workshops to test and iterate on our final app design, and presented our designs to our class along with design experts from IBM. </p>

    <h1>The impact of fake news</h1>
    <p> From an online survey of over 200+ participants, we found the following:</p>

    <h1>Research into the problem</h1>

    <p>Online research on our Target Audience, Students or Early Career Adults in their early to mid 20s, found the following out of 400+ survey participants.

    <h1>Feedback from Testing workshops</h1>
    <p>We tested our designs over 2 different workshops, where we synthesized test scripts and tasks for our testers to fulfill, while we watched, recorded, and took notes of their behaviour.

    <h2>Script Example</h2>

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Tester Goal Example.png">

    <p>From these workshops we were able to understand areas where users may have problems. These areas were synthesized into a Heuristic Evaluation Table.

    <h1>Assessing article credibility
    </h1>

    <h2>Metrics for assessing credibility</h2>
    <p>We determined how to measure credibility from our user interviews.</p>
    <div class="insightcont">
        <p class="bold">Source metrics</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Author credentials</li>
            <li>Credibility of Brand/Company</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="insightcont">
        <p class="bold">Content metrics</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number/quality of citations</li>
            <li>Number of supporting articles</li>
            <li>Presence of fake photos</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Presenting the credibility score</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>A lot of information at once, users feel reluctant to look through it all - it feels like "work"</li>
                <li>Users are confused as to how these scores are calculated, “why is something 74% vs 70%?”</li>
            </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Implemented gradual disclosure in the form of drop down menus to remove more detailed, less relevant information from the screen</li>

<!--REFLECTION-->

<h3 class="accent">Reflection</h3>
<h1>Finding a target audience</h1>

<p>Our mission for this project was to help combat the spread of misinformation online. 
    This being a grave issue that we, and a majority of our testers and surveyees felt serious about due to its immeasurable impact on our own,
     as well as others’ wellbeing. With Smart Read, we wanted to equip our users with an easier way to fact check and think critically of the information they are consuming.
      However, when doing our user research, most of the participants were around the downtown Toronto area and within circles of academia. 
    Our user research is based on this demographic of young, educated adults living in urban Canada. <span class="bold">Is this the population that is most susceptible to misinformation?</span></p>

<p>I believe we should have done preliminary research to see what demographic is most susceptible to misinformation, what kinds of misinformation is prone to being misconstrued,
      and what audience is likely to accept Smart Read as an intervention. Targeting the demographic that encompasses all 3 of these parameters 
    could really help us maximize Smart Read’s mission and <span class="bold">design Smart Read for the people that truly need it the most.</span></p>

<h3 class="accent">Going Forward</h3>
<h1>Sharing positivity</h1>
<p>There is ample space within Smart Read to introduce positive emotions.
     Going forward with this project, I would love for the Credibility Score page to have positive animations paired with a good credibility score,
      and less positive but still encouraging animations coupled with poor scores. Injecting these fun graphics or animations could really boost the
       experience of an application and also encourage behaviours as well.
    </p>

<p>I’d also like to add a <span class="bold">"share"</span> option, so users can share credibility scores at the same time they’d share a news article. 
    This may be of interest to different audiences and could also help with <span class="bold">app outreach, exposure, and encourage others to use Smart Read as well</span> - something that we are missing in the current iteration of the app.</p>
