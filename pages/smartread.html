<h2>üì∞ What is Fake News?</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="images/SmartRead/User research quotes.png" /></p>

<p>We‚Äôre exposed to an abundance of news articles, written pieces, and other information sources on social media. How do we know the validity of these sources - are they backed by research,
    or spreading misinformation? </p>

<h2>‚úèÔ∏èMy role</h2>
<p>Within a group of 5, I conducted in person interviews, contributed to both
     lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes, held workshops to test and iterate on our final app design, and presented our designs to our class along with design experts from IBM. </p>

<!--Justification-->

<h3>Justification</h3>
<h1>Fake news affects a good majority of us</h1>
<p>Preliminary research into this space found the following.</p>

<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="images/SmartRead/User research percentages.png" /></p>

<!--User research-->
<h3>User research</h3>
<h1>What kind of solution do people want?</h1>
<p>We conducted surveys and 1 on 1 interviews with people within the Toronto area and online to understand their thoughts around the subject.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/User research findings.png" /></p>

<h1>What is their current behaviour?</h1>

<p>I also created a heirarchical task analysis to understand current article consumption behaviour.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Hierarchical task analysis.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Clicking on the article removes the user from the main social media app, it is already a high risk and high effort action</li>
    <li>Our solution should not remove the user any further - if possible</li>
    <li>Not all parts of the article may be read</li>
</ul>

<h2>Based on these findings, we decided on the following principles</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Design Principles.png" /></p>

<h3>User testing</h3>
<h1>Feedback from Testing workshops</h1>
<p>We tested our designs over 2 different workshops, where we synthesized test scripts and tasks for our testers to fulfill, while we watched, recorded, and took notes of their behaviour.

<h2>Script Example</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Tester Goal Example.png" /></p>

<p>From these workshops we were able to understand areas where users may have problems. These areas were synthesized into a Heuristic Evaluation Table.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Test Findings.png" /></p>

<p> We will now look at each problem area in more depth.</p>

<h3>Design iterations</h3>
<h1>An app that does not disrupt flow</h1>

<p>With our Effortless design principle, we wanted the use of our main service to require minimum effort,
     so we decided to deliver it as a push notification upon opening a news article.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration 1.png" /></p>

<p>During testing, we found a number of issues with how we presented this information</p>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Testers did not notice the average score - they had to look for it</li>
    <li>Testers were confused by the Source and Content score, were they as important?</li>
    <li>Testers were not sure what the other listed articles were, they had to assume that these were related articles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration final.png"></p>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Average score is the largest number, and moved to a more upfront location</li>
        <li>Added a title for ‚ÄúRelated Articles‚Äù section</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Simple to understand</h1>

<p>3 of our design principles include Transparency, Empowerment, and Objectivity. Letting our users know how we create these credibility scores, making this process easy to understand, and educating and giving them easy and clear ways to make these judgments all contribute to these design principles. Thus, we need to make sure how we present this information is crystal clear as well.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration 1.png"></p>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>A lot of information at once, users feel reluctant to look through it all - it feels like "work"</li>
        <li>Users are confused as to how these scores are calculated, ‚Äúwhy is something 74% vs 70%?‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration final.png"></p>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Implemented gradual disclosure in the form of drop down menus to remove more detailed, less relevant information from the screen</li>
        <li>Included a score breakdown system to show exactly how scores are calculated</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Easy and clear navigation</h1>

<p>Another screen where we received a lot of feedback was our app home page.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration 1.png"></p>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Overall, this screen was confusing. Are the articles ones they‚Äôve read already? What do they have to do with the different tabs (Sources, Authors, Articles) at the top?</li>
        <li>Users were confused what the search bar was searching for - databases, or their recent article history?</li>
        <li>Delete icon was too small and too close to the ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù star icon - prone to both error and not noticeable enough
        </li>

    </ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>
<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration final.png"></p>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Changed location, color, and method of choosing a database so that it is more clearly affiliated with the search bar</li>
        <li>Added title to clearly indicate Viewed Articles, and separate them from the search bar</li>
        <li>Changed deleting articles to a swipe action, an industry standard action</li>
    </ul>


<!--Revisiting this project-->
<h3 class="accent">Update from 2021</h3>
<h1>Revisiting Smart Read</h1>

<p>When re-writing this case study, I noticed that our final iterations <span class="bold">did not adequately address the issues that the users encountered</span> - especially in our home page. 
    So this little section is me updating some of these designs to better address our usability issues.
