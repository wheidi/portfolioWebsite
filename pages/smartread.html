<h2>üì∞ What is Fake News?</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="images/SmartRead/User research quotes.png" /></p>

<p>We‚Äôre exposed to an abundance of news articles, written pieces, and other information sources on social media. How do we know the validity of these sources - are they backed by research,
    or spreading misinformation? </p>

<h2>‚úèÔ∏èMy role</h2>
<p>Within a group of 5, I conducted in person interviews, contributed to both
     lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes, held workshops to test and iterate on our final app design, and presented our designs to our class along with design experts from IBM. </p>

<!--Justification-->

<h3>Justification</h3>
<h1>Fake news affects a good majority of us</h1>
<p>Preliminary research into this space found the following.</p>

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/User research percentages.png">
</a>

<!--User research-->
<h3>User research</h3>
<h1>What kind of solution do people want?</h1>
<p>We conducted surveys and 1 on 1 interviews with people within the Toronto area and online to understand their thoughts around the subject.

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/User research findings.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/User research findings.png">
</a>

<h1>What is their current behaviour?</h1>

<p>I also created a heirarchical task analysis to understand current article consumption behaviour.

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Hierarchical task analysis.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Hierarchical task analysis.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Clicking on the article removes the user from the main social media app, it is already a high risk and high effort action</li>
    <li>Our solution should not remove the user any further - if possible</li>
    <li>Not all parts of the article may be read</li>
</ul>

<h2>Based on these findings, we decided on the following principles</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Design Principles.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Design Principles.png">
</a>


<h3>User testing</h3>
<h1>Feedback from Testing workshops</h1>
<p>We tested our designs over 2 different workshops, where we synthesized test scripts and tasks for our testers to fulfill, while we watched, recorded, and took notes of their behaviour.

<h2>Script Example</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Tester Goal Example.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Tester Goal Example.png">
</a>

<p>From these workshops we were able to understand areas where users may have problems. These areas were synthesized into a Heuristic Evaluation Table.

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Test Findings.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Test Findings.png">
</a>

<p> We will now look at each problem area in more depth.</p>

<h3>Design iterations</h3>
<h1>An app that does not disrupt flow</h1>

<p>With our Effortless design principle, we wanted the use of our main service to require minimum effort,
     so we decided to deliver it as a push notification upon opening a news article.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration 1.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration 1.png">
</a>

<p>During testing, we found a number of issues with how we presented this information</p>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Testers did not notice the average score - they had to look for it</li>
    <li>Testers were confused by the Source and Content score, were they as important?</li>
    <li>Testers were not sure what the other listed articles were, they had to assume that these were related articles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration final.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Notification iteration final.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Average score is the largest number, and moved to a more upfront location</li>
        <li>Added a title for ‚ÄúRelated Articles‚Äù section</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Simple to understand</h1>

<p>3 of our design principles include Transparency, Empowerment, and Objectivity. Letting our users know how we create these credibility scores, making this process easy to understand, and educating and giving them easy and clear ways to make these judgments all contribute to these design principles. Thus, we need to make sure how we present this information is crystal clear as well.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration 1.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration 1.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>A lot of information at once, users feel reluctant to look through it all - it feels like "work"</li>
        <li>Users are confused as to how these scores are calculated, ‚Äúwhy is something 74% vs 70%?‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration final.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Score breakdown iteration final.png">
</a>


<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Implemented gradual disclosure in the form of drop down menus to remove more detailed, less relevant information from the screen</li>
        <li>Included a score breakdown system to show exactly how scores are calculated</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Clear navigation and understanding page elements</h1>

<p>Another screen where we received a lot of feedback was our app home page.</p>

<h2>Initial iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration 1.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration 1.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Testing Insights </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Overall, this screen was confusing. Are the articles ones they‚Äôve read already? What do they have to do with the different tabs (Sources, Authors, Articles) at the top?</li>
        <li>Users were confused what the search bar was searching for - databases, or their recent article history?</li>
        <li>Delete icon was too small and too close to the ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù star icon - prone to both error and not noticeable enough
        </li>

    </ul>

<h2>Final iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration final.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Home page iteration final.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions </p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Changed location, color, and method of choosing a database so that it is more clearly affiliated with the search bar</li>
        <li>Added title to clearly indicate Viewed Articles, and separate them from the search bar</li>
        <li>Changed deleting articles to a swipe action, an industry standard action</li>
    </ul>


<!--Revisiting this project-->
<h3 class="accent">Update from 2021</h3>
<h1>Revisiting Smart Read</h1>

<p>When re-writing this case study, I noticed that our final iterations <span class="bold">did not adequately address the issues that the users encountered</span> - especially in our home page. 
    So I spent some time to address this.

<h2>Clear navigation and understanding page elements</h2>

<p>As previously stated, one of our main issues with the home page was that testers were confused about the search bar behaviour.</p>

<p class="bold">Tester expectations and behaviour</p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Search bar would search through their previously viewed articles</li>
        <li>Search bar would search through viewed articles based on ‚ÄúAuthors‚Äù or ‚ÄúTitles‚Äù or whichever drop down option was selected</li>
        <li>Testers did not expect the search bar to search through databases that had nothing to do with their article history</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Our final iteration does not solve this issue</h2>

<p>Though our final iteration in 2019 was a definite improvement from the first, however it still does not adequately solve the issues encountered by our testers.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Final iteration issues.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Final iteration issues.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Insights</p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>There is no indication that the Database Search Bar is <span class="bold">not</span> affiliated with the Viewed Articles section</li>
        <li>Violates Consistency and Standards Heuristic, usually search bars located on a page search the listed elements within the page, and not an independent database that has no affiliation with the other elements of the page</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Separating non-affiliated elements to minimize confusion</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Separating DB_History pages.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Separating DB_History pages.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions</p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Separated the Search databases search bar and Viewed Articles elements into different pages, so it is clear that these elements are not affiliated
        </li>
        <li>Replaced the ‚ÄúSmart Read‚Äù title bar to reflect the current page title</li>
        <li>Added a page navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, to easily access and tap on these different pages with the thumb</li>
    </ul>

<h2>New Article History page</h2>
<p>Taking a closer look at the newly designed, Article History page.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Article History page.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Article History page.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions</p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Page title now reflects the current page</li>
        <li>Search bar hint text indicates what this search bar is searching for</li>
        <li>Currently selected page is indicated by a lighter color on the navigation bar</li>
    </ul>

<h2> New Search Database page</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/SmartRead/Database Search page.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/SmartRead/Database Search page.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions</p>
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Search bar hint text indicates what this search bar is searching for</li>
        <li>Initial, empty search page illustration gives a suggestion on how to use the search bar and or how to use this Search Database page</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Updating remaining screens to maintain consistency</h2>

<p>Since I removed the red title bar and replaced it with a navy blue color, I needed to update the other screens to match this change as well.</p>

<p>Here are the remaining screens all together!</p>

<!--REFLECTION-->

<h3 class="accent">Reflection</h3>
<h1>Finding a target audience</h1>

<p>Our mission for this project was to help combat the spread of misinformation online. 
    This being a grave issue that we, and a majority of our testers and surveyees felt serious about due to its immeasurable impact on our own,
     as well as others‚Äô wellbeing. With Smart Read, we wanted to equip our users with an easier way to fact check and think critically of the information they are consuming.
      However, when doing our user research, most of the participants were around the downtown Toronto area and within circles of academia. 
    Our user research is based on this demographic of young, educated adults living in urban Canada. <span class="bold">Is this the population that is most susceptible to misinformation?</span></p>

<p>I believe we should have done preliminary research to see what demographic is most susceptible to misinformation, what kinds of misinformation is prone to being misconstrued,
      and what audience is likely to accept Smart Read as an intervention. Targeting the demographic that encompasses all 3 of these parameters 
    could really help us maximize Smart Read‚Äôs mission and <span class="bold">design Smart Read for the people that truly need it the most.</span></p>

<h3 class="accent">Going Forward</h3>
<h1>Sharing positivity</h1>
<p>There is ample space within Smart Read to introduce positive emotions.
     Going forward with this project, I would love for the Credibility Score page to have positive animations paired with a good credibility score,
      and less positive but still encouraging animations coupled with poor scores. Injecting these fun graphics or animations could really boost the
       experience of an application and also encourage behaviours as well.
    </p>

<p>I‚Äôd also like to add a <span class="bold">"share"</span> option, so users can share credibility scores at the same time they‚Äôd share a news article. 
    This would help with <span class="bold">app outreach, exposure, and encourage others to use Smart Read as well</span> - something that we are currently missing in the current iteration of the app.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's all for this case study. Thank you for reading!</p>
