<h2>Honeybee is a platform</h2>
<p>Honeybee is a platform that connects people to Research Studies in need of participants.
     Researchers post their research studies to the Study Hive, and users browse these studies
      and participate in them.</p>
<h2>My role in Honeybee</h2>
<p>At the time, I was Honeybee‚Äôs first and only UX Designer and Researcher.
     As such, I was responsible for leading each project from its varying levels of abstract
      ideation, to a concrete, implementable design. The Honeybee Profile Builder was one of
       these projects.</p>

<!--Research-->

<h3>Research</h3>
<h1>Discovering the problem</h1>
<p>From a recent survey on user experience, we found that 30% of our users were unsatisfied
     with our website. A teammate interviewed a few of these users, while I examined their 
     survey responses, and together we found that <span class="bold">49% of these unsatisfied users had 
        difficulty finding research studies.</span></p>


<h2>Understanding our user</h2> 
<p>From this research we noted that our target audience was mostly:
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Extrinsically motivated - they participated to gain monetary compensation</li>
        <li>Main behaviour was browsing our home page instead of searching for specific topics</li>
    </ul>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Persona.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Persona.png">

<h2>Understanding the main issue</h2>
<p>What makes research studies hard to find for the browsing experience?

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Homepage Comparison.png">

<h2>Gaining insight from other platforms</h2>
<p>I visited other platforms that offered health, research, or entertainment content to see
     how they offered personalized services.
     <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Extrinsically motivated - they participated to gain monetary compensation</li>

<h1>Addressing the solution in 2 parts</h1>
<p>From my market research, I found that a profile builder would fit the bill. I then 
    divided the profile builder into 2 parts.
    
    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Profile Builder Breakdown.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Profile Builder Breakdown.png">

<h1>Part 1: Planning the Questions and Answers</h2>

    <h2>Planning the Questions</h2>
        <p>Honeybee is unique in that we not only need personal interest information,
            but also a lot of demographic information to adequately filter out research studies.

        <p>I looked at existing studies on Honeybee, SickKids Children‚Äôs Hospital,
            research papers, and many other research study boards to see what criteria was
            often used to determine eligibility.

            <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Intake Criteria Graph.png">

                <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Intake Criteria Graph.png">

        <p class=bold>Question flow</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Questions only flow one.png">

                <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Questions only flow one.png">
            </a>

<h2>Planning the Answers</h2>

<p>How can I include and present all possible answers without overwhelming the user?

<p>Since the questions are multiple choice, I needed to figure out all answer options for each question.
     I had 2 main considerations here.</p>
     <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Include a minimal number of answer options to not overwhelm the user</li>
        <li>Be inclusive and make sure all individuals will feel represented,
             avoid the use of the answer option, ‚Äúother‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Spotlight: Representing Physiological Health Information</h2>

<p>I looked at medical intake charts, personalized health care websites,
     surveys, and other resources for inclusivity to better understand the possible answers
      to include.

<p>After a brainstorming session with my manager, we decided on a ‚Äúbody‚Äù approach where
     we‚Äôd present each answer option as a specific part of the body, and cover the entire
      human body.

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Medical Examples.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Medical Examples.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Inclusive - this would include all physical health conditions</li>
    <li>Minimal number of answer options and avoid overwhelming users</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
    <ul class="insightcont">
        <li>Users may be looking for their specific condition name at first </li>
    </ul>

<h1>Reviewing the question flow</h1>

<h2>Iteration 1</h2>

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Flow One.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Felt long with 4 different sections</li>
    <li>Questions about children could be too invasive for a signup survey, causing people to leave early</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Iteration</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Flow Final.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Flow Final.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Only the bare minimum of questions are asked</li>
    <li>Removed any less mandatory, highly invasive questions</li>

</ul>


<h1>Part 2: Designing the Profile Builder</h1>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Cades Mindset.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Cades Mindset.png">
</a>

<p>Considering this, I decided on the following conditions for the design of the profile builder:

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Considerations Horizontal.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Considerations Horizontal.png">
</a>

<h2>üòé Questions are easy to answer</h2>

<p>We have 2 different question types. Some questions are straight forward whereas others require more thought. How do we make some questions go smoothly and quickly, and encourage more effort on others?

<h2>Multiple Select Questions</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Multi select.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Multi select.gif">
</a>

<h4>How can we encourage users to select more answers?</h4>

<p>Questions that involve multiple selections require more thought compared to single select questions. How do we encourage our users to look at more options and consider them?

<h2>The inspiration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/multi select inspiration.png" /></p>

<p>I pulled ideas from Spotify, Dribbble, and Youtube. Here, the behaviour is likely to look for something relevant and select it. This is the exact motivation that we want answering our multi-select questions.


<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Images invite the user to look and see, whereas a lot of text is often ignored</li>
    <li>Image is usually looked at first to capture interest and identify what the piece of media is about</li>
    <li>Text information/titles are usually looked at next to give further context</li>
    <li>An exception: visual hierarchy can be established based on location of text in image, if text is near the top, may read it first</li>

</ul>

<p>The key was to encourage our users to spend more time looking at every option and selecting them, as opposed to beelining for the minimum needed and continuing on.

    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/multi select focus pic.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/multi select focus pic.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Square shapes with plentiful padding + simplistic icons to avoid looking overcrowded</li>
    <li>Prototypical icons to help convey meaning and encourage users to process information with the least amount of effort</li>
    <li>Text to help clarify the categories</li>
    <li>Vibrant and consistent selection colors to elicit more positive affect when you select an option </li>
</ul>

<h2>Singular Select Questions</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/single select.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/single select.gif">
</a>

<h4>How to make these questions the easiest and fastest to answer?</h4>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Use common language that they would expect/are looking for</li>
    <li>Simplistic design with no extra material to be processed</li>
    <li>Text to help clarify the categories</li>
    <li>Order responses such that the most common ones are at the top</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚è±Ô∏è Feels short and fast to complete</h2>

<p>Not only did we want our profile builder to be objectively as short as possible, but also to be perceived as such.

<h2>Hot Keys</h2>

<p>I added a hot key option, where pressing space bar would function as if clicking the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button

<p>The ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button would have a prompt beside it, telling users to ‚Äúpress spacebar‚Äù

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/hotkey next.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/hotkey next.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>The entire survey could be done from one hand position, without moving either hand</li>
    <li>Simplistic design with no extra material to be processed</li>
    <li>The mouse would not need to travel long distances to the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, decreasing time and effort required</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>In multiple select questions, users would see the prompt and eagerly go to the next question, selecting less answers than they otherwise would have</li>
</ul>

<p>To accommodate for this con, I decided to not display the ‚Äúpress spacebar‚Äù prompt in multiple select questions.

<h2>Feelings of accomplishment throughout</h2>

<p>I broke up the profile builder into 3 sections, breaking one big task into 3 mini tasks.

    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Sections.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Sections.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>The section with the least amount of questions is in the middle, making it very easy to complete up to section 2 / 3.</li>
    <li>Users would be more likely to complete the Profile Builder, as they‚Äôve made sizeable progress (2 / 3 sections) and wouldn‚Äôt want to see it go to waste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual progress that feels impactful</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/space hotkey.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/space hotkey.gif">
</a>

<p>Progress feels good! We wanted a progress bar that felt satisfying but was still informative of how much of the survey users  had left.

<h2>Option 1</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 2.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 2.gif">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Progress bar is easy to notice and is at a standard location</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Confusing what the lighter orange color could represent</li>
    <li>3 separate sections are not clear</li>
    <li>Unfinished sections span a large portion of the screen</li>
    <li>User will likely notice the progress bar when it is not progressing (when they read the question/when eyes are at the top of the screen)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Option 2</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 1.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 1.gif">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Clearly see that there are 3 different sections</li>
    <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Confusing whether the circles are sections or questions themselves</li>
    <li>Unfinished/irrelevant portions of progress bar still take up a lot of space</li>

</ul>

<h2>Option 3</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 3.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 3.gif">
</a>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 3.5.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 3.5.gif">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>3 different sections are clearly indicated</li>
    <li>Current section takes up the most space, incomplete sections do not look too long</li>
    <li>Progress bar growth animation is bigger</li>
    <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Users may not initially know what each individual progress bar represents</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided on Option 3 for the Progress Bar, as the pros are relevant and outweigh the cons. It it likely also, that once a question is answered the meaning of the different progress bars will be apparent.

<h2>üîé Transparency and comfort when giving personal information</h2>

<p>Many of the questions in the profile builder are going to ask about sensitive topics. Like how Cade‚Äôs mindset indicated, how would we comfort and relieve the feelings of risk that may come with divulging this information?

<h2>General privacy policy statements at the beginning of a section</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Health Section.png">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Health Section.png">
</a>

<p>Privacy policy statements are included before a section with sensitive questions. Users generally only seek this information once. If they are worried later about how their information is being used, repeating our privacy policy will likely not help. Instead we‚Äôd give more specific information on why questions are being asked.


<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>General Privacy Policy statement is presented once at the beginning of the section to address general worries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personalized statements for specific questions</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Info bubble.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Info bubble.gif">
</a>

<p>I added ‚Äúi‚Äù buttons beside sensitive questions to let users know how this specific information is used and why we are asking it, including the greater impact it has in research. Hopefully, to build some prosocial motivation and to introduce the capacity of our product as well.

    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/info bubble focus.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/info bubble focus.png">
</a>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Info bubble appears beside sensitive questions to inform users how exactly that information will be used</li>
    <li>Mentions its prosocial impact on the world to help introduce our product‚Äôs mission and build prosocial motivation</li>

</ul>

<!--FINAL PRODUCT-->
<h3 class="accent">The Final Product</h3>
<h1>A profile builder for a personalized experience</h1>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 65.39509536784742%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/0e3bea7987e0466d911b1f98fe92f22d" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

<br>
<br>

<p>The final product is a profile builder that appears upon signup. It takes less than 3 minutes and collects a reasonable amount of information from the user. This information will be used to present research studies that the user is eligible for, and may be interested in.

<p class="bold">What does this solution do?
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Personalized experience for the user</li>
    <li>Easier for new and returning users to engage with Honeybee and participate in research studies</li>
    <li>Slower onboarding time, but is projected to improve conversion KPIs</li>

</ul>

<!--REFLECTION-->

<h3 class="accent">Reflection</h3>
<h1>More user testing</h1>
<p>Due to our limited time and resources, we could not conduct user testing on many of the design decisions. As such, many of my decisions were based on <span class="bold">pre-existing research</span> from resources I could find online, <span class="bold">feedback from my work peers and manager</span>, and my own experience both as a student in the research space and as an aspiring UX designer as well.</p>


<p>If we could‚Äôve conducted user testing, then many of the design decisions would be more well informed, pain points would be more realistic and accurate, and we could truly get a picture of our users‚Äô needs as well. As it stands, I did my best to empathize with Cade and to understand his needs. Hopefully moving forward, once we get metrics on how our profile builder and KPIs are affected, we can improve and iterate as needed.


<h3 class="accent">Most Notable Feedback + Going Forward</h3>
<h1>Telling a Story</h1>
<p>A piece of feedback that stood out to me was, "this should feel like it's telling a story". I hadn't realized it, but I was only barely grazing the surface of what a well crafted profile builder could do. Though an experience could feel good by optimizing the visuals and elements, how to marry all of these together and tell a story was truly the soul of the challenge. Structuring the questions, giving them a logical order, giving the graphics a logical order, wording them consistently, these all contributed to the overall story of the experience. 


<p>I do believe a profile builder has a lot of opportunities to be fun and exciting. Moving forward I‚Äôd love to design a similar profile builder that draws on the elements of character building in many online games. 


<p>This could be done simply through the progress indicator. Making a lightbulb light up, a flower bloom, or a slime blob grow into a personalized slime. The possibilities are endless!
