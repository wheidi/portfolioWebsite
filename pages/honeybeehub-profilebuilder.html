<h2>Honeybee is a platform</h2>
<p>Honeybee is a platform that connects people to Research Studies in need of participants.
     Researchers post their research studies to the Study Hive, and users browse these studies
      and participate in them.</p>
<h2>My role in Honeybee</h2>
<p>At the time, I was Honeybee‚Äôs first and only UX Designer and Researcher.
     As such, I was responsible for leading each project from its varying levels of abstract
      ideation, to a concrete, implementable design. The Honeybee Profile Builder was one of
       these projects.</p>

<!--Research-->

<div class="tag section">
<h1>Discovering the problem</h1>
<p>From a recent survey on user experience, we found that 30% of our users were unsatisfied
     with our website. A teammate interviewed a few of these users, while I examined their 
     survey responses, and together we found the following.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>49% of unsatisfied users had difficulty finding research studies</li>

        <li>These users were extrinsically motivated - their main goal was to gain compensation</li>
        <li>Their main behaviour was browsing our home page instead of searching for specific topics</li>
    </ul>

<p>What makes research studies hard to find for the browsing experience?

</div>

<div class=section>
<h2>Gaining insight from other platforms</h2>
<p>I visited other platforms that offered health, research, or entertainment content to see
     how they offered personalized services.
     <ul>
        <li>Other platforms used a survey upon sign up to collect user information</li>
        <li>This information would be used to give them a more personalized experience
        </li>
    </ul>

    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Competitive Benchmark Summary.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Competitive Benchmark Summary.png">
</a>

<p>From my market research, I found that a profile builder would fit the bill. I then 
    divided the profile builder into 2 parts, the questions to ask and the visual design.

<h1>Part 1: Planning the Questions and Answers</h1>
    <h2>Planning the Questions</h2>
        <p>Honeybee is unique in that we not only need personal interest information,
            but also a lot of demographic information to filter out research studies.

        <p>I looked at existing studies on Honeybee, SickKids Children‚Äôs Hospital,
            research papers, and many other research study boards to see what criteria was
            often used to determine eligibility.

            <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Intake Criteria Graph.png">

                <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Intake Criteria Graph.png">
            </a>
        
            <p>I drafted the questions based on these criteria into a question flow</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Questions only flow one.png">

                <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Questions only flow one.png">
            </a>

<h2>Planning the Answers</h2>

<p>Since the questions are multiple choice, I needed to figure out all answer options for each question.
     I had 2 main considerations here.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Include a minimal number of answer options to not overwhelm the user</li>
        <li>Be inclusive and make sure all individuals will feel represented,
             avoid the use of the answer option, ‚Äúother‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

<p>For physiological health answers, I looked at medical intake charts, personalized health care websites,
     surveys, and other resources for inclusivity to better understand the possible answers
      to include.

<p>We found that the best approach was to present each body part as a health category, as opposed to naming all the possible health conditions.

<h2>Reviewing the question flow</h2>


<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Initial Feedback
        <ul>
            <li>Felt long with 4 different sections</li>
            <li>Questions about children felt too invasive for a signup survey</li>
        
        </ul>
</div>


<h4>Final Iteration</h4>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
        <ul>
            <li>Only the bare minimum of questions are asked</li>
            <li>Removed any less mandatory, highly invasive questions</li>
        
        </ul>

<h1>Part 2: Designing the Profile Builder</h1>

<h2>Design principles</h2>

<p>Because our target audience is extrinsically motivated, I decided on the following design principles.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Considerations Horizontal.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Considerations Horizontal.png">
</a>

<h2>üòé Easy questions with multiple answers</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Multi select.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Multi select.gif">
</a>

<p>The goal with these questions is to encourage our users to select more answers.</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/multi select focus pic.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/multi select focus pic.png">
</a>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
    <ul>
        <li>Square shapes with plentiful padding + simplistic icons to avoid looking overcrowded</li>
        <li>Prototypical icons to help convey meaning and encourage users to process information with the least amount of effort</li>
        <li>Text to help clarify the categories</li>
        <li>Vibrant and consistent selection colors to elicit more positive affect when you select an option </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>üòé Easy questions with one answer</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/single select.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/single select.gif">
</a>

<p>I wanted to make these questions as fast and easy-to-answer as possible.</p>
<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
        <ul>
            <li>Use common language that they would expect</li>
            <li>Simplistic design with no extra material to be processed</li>
            <li>Order responses such that the most common ones are at the top</li>
        </ul>
        
</div>

<h2>‚è±Ô∏è Fast hot keys</h2>

<p>I added a hot key option, where pressing space bar would function as if clicking the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/hotkey next.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/hotkey next.png">
</a>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Pros
        <ul>
            <li>The entire survey could be done from one hand position, without moving either hand</li>
            <li>The mouse would not need to travel long distances to the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, decreasing time and effort required</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Cons
        <ul class="insightcont">
            <li>In multiple select questions, users would see the prompt and eagerly go to the next question, selecting less answers than they otherwise would have</li>
        </ul>
</div>


<p>To accommodate for this con, I decided to not display the ‚Äúpress spacebar‚Äù prompt in multiple select questions.

<h2>‚è±Ô∏è Short sub-sections</h2>


    <a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Sections.png">

        <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Question Sections.png">
</a>

<p>I broke up the profile builder into 3 sections to increase motivation within the users.

    <div class="insightcont">
        <p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
            <ul>
                <li>The section with the least amount of questions is in the middle, making it easy to complete up to section 2 / 3</li>
                <li>Users would likely complete the builder after section 2, as they'd only have one section left</li>
            </ul>
    </div>


<h2>‚è±Ô∏è Progress bar that feels productive</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/space hotkey.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/space hotkey.gif">
</a>

<p>Progress feels good! I wanted a progress bar that maximized the feeling of productivity, while still being accurate in informing the user.

<h4>Option 1</h4>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 2.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 2.gif">

            <li>Progress bar is easy to notice and is at a standard location</li>
        
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Cons
        <ul>
            <li>Confusing what the lighter orange color could represent</li>
            <li>3 separate sections are not clear</li>
            <li>Unfinished sections span a large portion of the screen</li>
            <li>User will likely notice the progress bar when it is not progressing (when they read the question/when eyes are at the top of the screen)</li>
        </ul>
        
</div>

<h4>Option 2</h4>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 1.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Progress bar 1.gif">
</a>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Pros
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly see that there are 3 different sections</li>
            <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="insightcont">
    <p class="bold">Cons
        <ul>
            <li>Confusing whether the circles are sections or questions themselves</li>
            <li>Unfinished/irrelevant portions of progress bar still take up a lot of space</li>
        
        </ul>
</div>


<h4>Option 3 - Final Progress Bar</h4>

        <li>Current section takes up the most space, incomplete sections do not look too long</li>
        <li>Progress bar growth animation is bigger</li>
        <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>

    </ul>
</div>

<h2>üîé Initial privacy statement</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="images/HBProfileBuilder/Info bubble.gif">

    <p><img class="imgcontainer" src="images/HBProfileBuilder/Info bubble.gif">

<div class=section>
<!--REFLECTION-->

<h3 class="accent">Reflection</h3>
<h1>More user testing</h1>
<p>Due to our limited time and resources, we could not conduct user testing on many of the design decisions. As such, many of my decisions were based on <span class="bold">pre-existing research</span> from resources I could find online, <span class="bold">feedback from my work peers and manager</span>, and my own experience both as a student in the research space and as an aspiring UX designer as well.</p>


<p>If we could‚Äôve conducted user testing, then many of the design decisions would be more well informed, pain points would be more realistic and accurate, and we could truly get a picture of our users‚Äô needs as well. As it stands, I did my best to empathize with Cade and to understand his needs. Hopefully moving forward, once we get metrics on how our profile builder and KPIs are affected, we can improve and iterate as needed.


<h3 class="accent">Feedback + Going Forward</h3>
<h1>Telling a Story</h1>
<p>A piece of feedback that stood out to me was, "this should feel like it's telling a story". I hadn't realized it, but I was only barely grazing the surface of what a well crafted profile builder could do. Though an experience could feel good by optimizing the visuals and elements, how to marry all of these together and tell a story was truly the soul of the challenge. Structuring the questions, giving them a logical order, giving the graphics a logical order, wording them consistently, these all contributed to the overall story of the experience. 


<p>I do believe a profile builder has a lot of opportunities to be fun and exciting. Moving forward I‚Äôd love to design a similar profile builder that draws on the elements of character building in many online games. 


<p>This could be done simply through the progress indicator. Making a lightbulb light up, a flower bloom, or a slime blob grow into a personalized slime. The possibilities are endless!
