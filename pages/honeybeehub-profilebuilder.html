<h2>üêùWho is Honeybee?</h2>
<p>‚ÄúHow has Social Distancing Affected Your Well Being?‚Äù Honeybee connects people to Research Studies to answer questions such as these. Researchers post their research studies to the Study Hive, and users browse these studies and participate! Honeybee aims to make research participation accessible and inclusive, and not just tied tightly within academia. As a psychology student, I could not resonate more with this mission. </p>

<h2>üé®Who am I in Honeybee?</h2>
<p>During my Internship, I was Honeybee‚Äôs one and only Designer Bee. I was responsible for UX design and research and was tasked with designing new or current features to improve the usability, experience, and feasibility of our website and app. The Honeybee Profile Builder was likely the most challenging out of all the projects I tackled. </p>

<!--Research-->

<h3>Research</h3>
<h1>Participating in research studies is too difficult</h1>
<p>From a recent survey on user experience, we found that <span class="bold">30% of our users were unsatisfied with our website</span>. We wanted to know why. So, we interviewed these users and examined their survey responses to find out.</p>

<p><img class="imgcontainer center" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/fa17257402eaa9852c30b4bbcf623fc1/277de7b755b390e7-d9/s500x750/1f8a6541c9a2a330fc0615385802eced2c6afd10.png" /></p>

<p>And here we have our main issue.

<h2>Understanding our user</h2>
<p>According to the same survey, a majority of our users are motivated by the reward incentive. Taking this, and other demographic information from our user base, I drafted a persona.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd822ca225a181e8d14b429d4096c4f3/1f38f63b70a4f292-d4/s1280x1920/74962ee9b012461a7f021d1bdc06c6eb14f9e734.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Cade isn't looking for specific research studies, his behaviour will likely be browsing the Study Hive and not searching with the search bar</li>
    <li>Cade is extrinsically motivated, thus will likely have less patience and spend less effort</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding current roadblocks</h2>
<p>Ideally, we‚Äôd be able to test this with our users, but due to limited resources we couldn‚Äôt. Instead, I tried to go through the flow myself as Cade.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b0e0db41918977fbe8e1186d256cdc19/1f38f63b70a4f292-af/s2048x3072/afcc8a370a94d34f63433b4ec72d61b3fd15bee2.png" /></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of our homepage and is exactly what Cade would encounter.

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Cade is not eligible for a majority of the research studies he sees</li>
    <li>Repeated rejection after spending effort on these research studies will exacerbate his limited patience and effort</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gaining insight from other platforms</h2>
<p>We needed to get Cade directly to the research studies that are relevant to him. But how to do that? I did some Competitive Benchmarking on other health, research, and content platforms to see how they gave personalized user results from the get-go.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a8b5a3e506c13f0c75b7c11d966ebf42/1f38f63b70a4f292-1d/s1280x1920/db4a5ab38e6f804c9f388a0b73fb9ead23b62d52.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Other platforms used a survey upon sign up to collect user information</li>
    <li>This information would be used to give them a more personalized experience</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planning</h3>
<h1>Breaking down a profile builder</h1>
<p>I decided to go with a profile builder upon signup as it provides the following:

<h4>A profile builder presents users with what their interested in, saving them time and effort</h4>

<h2>Components of a Profile Builder</h2>
<p>I divided the profile builder into 2 mini projects to tackle:

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/13b140743c1b3bafd005392af58472be/277de7b755b390e7-c4/s2048x3072/58045ef00de3b557c2e25703a066df13708a1980.png" /></p>

<h2>Designing the questions</h2>
<h4>What must we know about Cade, to filter out irrelevant research studies?</h4>

<p>Honeybee is unique in that we not only need personal interest information, but also a lot of demographic information. If Cade is a 26 year old male living in the US, we do not want to show him research studies for elderly couples living in the UK.

<p>I did some data analysis on the research studies we had and their intake criteria along with research studies from Sick Kids and other Academia Sources, taking note of each and every one.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8693760ec094dcff9a6f607d3bb10f3c/277de7b755b390e7-61/s2048x3072/f37aad16732ba4db728ba51f5eb175e3399b1a03.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Research studies reject participants most often based on health conditions, location, having children, and age</li>

</ul>

<h2>Designing the answers</h2>

<h4>How can I include and present all possible answers without overwhelming the user?</h4>

<p>Since the questions are multiple choice, I also needed to figure out all answer options for each question.

A pretty daunting task was to make sure the answer options were inclusive to every individual. Every health condition, identity, etc. We want our users to feel seen and not have to choose ‚ÄúOther‚Äù.

<h2>Spotlight: Representing Health Information</h2>

<p>To list out all possible health conditions would be overwhelming for the user to sift through and select. I wanted to reduce the possible options for health conditions, while still being inclusive of all the health conditions available.

<p>I did extensive research looking at medical intake charts, personalized health care websites, surveys, and other resources for inclusivity to better understand the possible answers to include.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f3a5e42b0a31dd9b6f791975d0ec7650/1f38f63b70a4f292-97/s2048x3072/30db2ec3114ec0d6829c454ebeb40b00efce97b8.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Health conditions are often generalized to categories of conditions such as heart, lung, or neurological conditions</li>

</ul>

<h3>Testing and Iterating</h3>
<h1>Testing the Question Flow</h1>
<p>Before moving on to designs, my manager and I went over the question flow.

<h2>Iteration 1</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dddb212305e88b172e378349979db940/ade83e10d2c8a2da-34/s2048x3072/f7d29286b262e1f16b58e03f4c3f0c7c0e32416e.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Felt long with 4 different sections</li>
    <li>Questions about children could be too invasive for a signup survey, causing people to leave early</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Iteration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1c3056faf1236a43a7ffbb8f07f30845/ade83e10d2c8a2da-a3/s1280x1920/ff4a52eadcd9aca420f91adc9906dd14fc71efa9.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Only the bare minimum of questions are asked</li>
    <li>Removed any less mandatory, highly invasive questions</li>

</ul>

<h3>Design</h3>
<h1>Designing the Profile Builder</h1>

<p>What would Cade‚Äôs mindset be, upon encountering this Profile Builder?

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/98d9d41f00bacc263a3a18fcfef5771c/277de7b755b390e7-0d/s1280x1920/89b664774d8c7d165c26b0858824511ea90004b3.png" /></p>

<p>Considering this, I decided on the following conditions for the design of the profile builder:

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2d01c011b454afe6e38359f977116d20/ade83e10d2c8a2da-a3/s1280x1920/0db88e91cd100a1130a39a5707c4a82756d338d7.png" /></p>

<h2>üòé Questions are easy to answer</h2>

<p>We have 2 different question types. Some questions are straight forward whereas others require more thought. How do we make some questions go smoothly and quickly, and encourage more effort on others?

<h2>Multiple Select Questions</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/389db5f0af09239058c596f544737031/e11929208d8383ce-f2/s2048x3072/afd1e65dc7b9c5e54daeeac87ab0b21cf2e9e11f.gifv" /></p>

<h4>How can we encourage users to select more answers?</h4>

<p>Questions that involve multiple selections require more thought compared to single select questions. How do we encourage our users to look at more options and consider them?

<h2>The inspiration</h2>

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0ed3ffcd84a85b4d5fd897517243b2f0/4bcdd40e520fc82e-b8/s2048x3072/8f09189fa520b37d19381cfc252967aa0e05416a.png" /></p>

<p>I pulled ideas from Spotify, Dribbble, and Youtube. Here, the behaviour is likely to look for something relevant and select it. This is the exact motivation that we want answering our multi-select questions.


<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Images invite the user to look and see, whereas a lot of text is often ignored</li>
    <li>Image is usually looked at first to capture interest and identify what the piece of media is about</li>
    <li>Text information/titles are usually looked at next to give further context</li>
    <li>An exception: visual hierarchy can be established based on location of text in image, if text is near the top, may read it first</li>

</ul>

<p>The key was to encourage our users to spend more time looking at every option and selecting them, as opposed to beelining for the minimum needed and continuing on.

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/000bf159f8788cce2f45c5104b0d7266/e11929208d8383ce-01/s2048x3072/5408c2dd09608a88a8b2116589f7ac12eeea9967.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Square shapes with plentiful padding + simplistic icons to avoid looking overcrowded</li>
    <li>Prototypical icons to help convey meaning and encourage users to process information with the least amount of effort</li>
    <li>Text to help clarify the categories</li>
    <li>Vibrant and consistent selection colors to elicit more positive affect when you select an option </li>
</ul>

<h2>Singular Select Questions</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d2652e9e50887cde99df118cd3867d3/4bcdd40e520fc82e-f0/s2048x3072/89aa24f3d9f6b727b841d02e677b68d985a4779c.gifv" /></p>

<h4>How to make these questions the easiest and fastest to answer?</h4>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Use common language that they would expect/are looking for</li>
    <li>Simplistic design with no extra material to be processed</li>
    <li>Text to help clarify the categories</li>
    <li>Order responses such that the most common ones are at the top</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚è±Ô∏è Feels short and fast to complete</h2>

<p>Not only did we want our profile builder to be objectively as short as possible, but also to be perceived as such.

<h2>Hot Keys</h2>

<p>I added a hot key option, where pressing space bar would function as if clicking the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button

<p>The ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button would have a prompt beside it, telling users to ‚Äúpress spacebar‚Äù

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a34f8ae2a37f2d22b9858f26a9f5535a/e11929208d8383ce-be/s1280x1920/a6ff80029c2b473496251131c90c69c051cb8d12.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>The entire survey could be done from one hand position, without moving either hand</li>
    <li>Simplistic design with no extra material to be processed</li>
    <li>The mouse would not need to travel long distances to the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, decreasing time and effort required</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>In multiple select questions, users would see the prompt and eagerly go to the next question, selecting less answers than they otherwise would have</li>
</ul>

<p>To accommodate for this con, I decided to not display the ‚Äúpress spacebar‚Äù prompt in multiple select questions.

<h2>Feelings of accomplishment throughout</h2>

<p>I broke up the profile builder into 3 sections, breaking one big task into 3 mini tasks.

<p><img class="imgcontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/723628fe125921e03d17080e9bf7cdb2/277de7b755b390e7-81/s2048x3072/7fa2df94540b4d778081e8538f89135a965223a3.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Key Design Decisions
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>The section with the least amount of questions is in the middle, making it very easy to complete up to section 2 / 3.</li>
    <li>Users would be more likely to complete the Profile Builder, as they‚Äôve made sizeable progress (2 / 3 sections) and wouldn‚Äôt want to see it go to waste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual progress that feels impactful</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8d7763d7c12236274b63e8d408ef531/4bcdd40e520fc82e-51/s2048x3072/b0081667dfb28362706a6c22cc7791cf456ec2d7.gifv" /></p>

<p>Progress feels good! We wanted a progress bar that felt satisfying but was still informative of how much of the survey users  had left.

<h2>Option 1</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/24c60c2d83c3e56c28af7f9ab1f9049a/4bcdd40e520fc82e-ce/s2048x3072/6c3ed7ae4bc487a9e14f6cdceacbfcaa58c58185.gifv" /></p>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Progress bar is easy to notice and is at a standard location</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Confusing what the lighter orange color could represent</li>
    <li>3 separate sections are not clear</li>
    <li>Unfinished sections span a large portion of the screen</li>
    <li>User will likely notice the progress bar when it is not progressing (when they read the question/when eyes are at the top of the screen)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Option 2</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee7c25cd8f7144508387201ce59e4e78/e11929208d8383ce-48/s2048x3072/8e8647ae6fe17e3b3eaa5de745e9b6fa16f5f3fc.gifv" /></p>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Clearly see that there are 3 different sections</li>
    <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Confusing whether the circles are sections or questions themselves</li>
    <li>Unfinished/irrelevant portions of progress bar still take up a lot of space</li>

</ul>

<h2>Option 3</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9f28ae6354570db9c8401164fe87f90a/4bcdd40e520fc82e-aa/s2048x3072/a9f48e519fbbf6b83625416863acabc8b7582ab1.gifv" /></p>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/38a09db1d3dc09604654640bb45b7864/4bcdd40e520fc82e-49/s2048x3072/8055f17358faea027d34d0ddae2f9d2a7046bcc7.gifv" /></p>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>3 different sections are clearly indicated</li>
    <li>Current section takes up the most space, incomplete sections do not look too long</li>
    <li>Progress bar growth animation is bigger</li>
    <li>User is more likely to view the progress bar when it will be growing - when the user interacts with the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button</li>

</ul>

<p class="bold">Cons
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Users may not initially know what each individual progress bar represents</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided on Option 3 for the Progress Bar, as the pros are relevant and outweigh the cons. It it likely also, that once a question is answered the meaning of the different progress bars will be apparent.

<h2>üîé Transparency and comfort when giving personal information</h2>

<p>Many of the questions in the profile builder are going to ask about sensitive topics. Like how Cade‚Äôs mindset indicated, how would we comfort and relieve the feelings of risk that may come with divulging this information?

<h2>General privacy policy statements at the beginning of a section</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d47a23569ddede06f4bf3d20db007338/e11929208d8383ce-d3/s2048x3072/deb65b83e239af37c031f9ec8749052ae7b93087.png" /></p>

<p>Privacy policy statements are included before a section with sensitive questions. Users generally only seek this information once. If they are worried later about how their information is being used, repeating our privacy policy will likely not help. Instead we‚Äôd give more specific information on why questions are being asked.


<p class="bold">Insights
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>General Privacy Policy statement is presented once at the beginning of the section to address general worries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personalized statements for specific questions</h2>

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7c041fa7dba52e91a679d97514a2d345/e11929208d8383ce-8b/s2048x3072/74d974bd5277560171dd51657b67b8de8b6e327c.gifv" /></p>

<p>I added ‚Äúi‚Äù buttons beside sensitive questions to let users know how this specific information is used and why we are asking it, including the greater impact it has in research. Hopefully, to build some prosocial motivation and to introduce the capacity of our product as well.

<p><img class="imgscreencontainer" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/007a8e9c0a53ee1fca0d9c1318003afa/e11929208d8383ce-ec/s2048x3072/65a884cb2baa18d506614732f05b7d8a31fafa05.png" /></p>

<p class="bold">Pros
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Info bubble appears beside sensitive questions to inform users how exactly that information will be used</li>
    <li>Mentions its prosocial impact on the world to help introduce our product‚Äôs mission and build prosocial motivation</li>

</ul>

<!--FINAL PRODUCT-->
<h3 class="accent">The Final Product</h3>
<h1>A profile builder for a personalized experience</h1>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 65.39509536784742%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/0e3bea7987e0466d911b1f98fe92f22d" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

<br>
<br>

<p>The final product is a profile builder that appears upon signup. It takes less than 3 minutes and collects a reasonable amount of information from the user. This information will be used to present research studies that the user is eligible for, and may be interested in.

<p class="bold">What does this solution do?
<ul class="insightcont">
    <li>Personalized experience for the user</li>
    <li>Easier for new and returning users to engage with Honeybee and participate in research studies</li>
    <li>Slower onboarding time, but is projected to improve conversion KPIs</li>

</ul>

<!--REFLECTION-->

<h3 class="accent">Reflection</h3>
<h1>More user testing</h1>
<p>Due to our limited time and resources, we could not conduct user testing on many of the design decisions. As such, many of my decisions were based on <span class="bold">pre-existing research</span> from resources I could find online, <span class="bold">feedback from my work peers and manager</span>, and my own experience both as a student in the research space and as an aspiring UX designer as well.</p>


<p>If we could‚Äôve conducted user testing, then many of the design decisions would be more well informed, pain points would be more realistic and accurate, and we could truly get a picture of our users‚Äô needs as well. As it stands, I did my best to empathize with Cade and to understand his needs. Hopefully moving forward, once we get metrics on how our profile builder and KPIs are affected, we can improve and iterate as needed.

<h1>Telling a Story</h1>
<p>A piece of feedback that stood out to me was, "this should feel like it's telling a story". I hadn't realized it, but I was only barely grazing the surface of what a well crafted profile builder could do. Though an experience could feel good by optimizing the visuals and elements, how to marry all of these together and tell a story was truly the soul of the challenge. Structuring the questions, giving them a logical order, giving the graphics a logical order, wording them consistently, these all contributed to the overall story of the experience. 


<p>I do believe a profile builder has a lot of opportunities to be fun and exciting. Moving forward I‚Äôd love to design a similar profile builder that draws on the elements of character building in many online games. 


<p>This could be done simply through the progress indicator. Making a lightbulb light up, a flower bloom, or a slime blob grow into a personalized slime. The possibilities are endless!
