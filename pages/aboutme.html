            <h2><span class="bold">🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Psychology</span>: Understanding others and myself</h2>
            <p>"Positive emotions encourage approach-behaviour".
                Psychology can tell us so much about how users perceive experiences; how emotions and styles of motivation can encourage or discourage behaviours.
                Incorporating these principles into my design process and work habits provide me great insight into a user's experience and my own work patterns as well.

        <h2><span class="bold">🧢 Empathy</span>: Wearing different hats</h2>
        <p>A big part of understanding an audience is empathizing with them. This includes the user, the industry, and any identity or community involved. Whenever I encountered a question where there was less research to inform the next step, I found that a solid starting point would almost always 
            be to put on my user hat, become the user, and go from there.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="rcolumn">
        <h2><span class="bold">🎇 Awe</span>: A sense of wonder</h2>
        <p>A more personal preference, but I found that a good, smooth experience always gave me some sense of awe. Research here also points to awe being affiliated with
            a slew of positive psychological effects that I won't get into, but that we can definitely chat about 😉. Even something as simple as a loading animation can elicit awe, and thus is
            an experience that I personally aspire to craft.
