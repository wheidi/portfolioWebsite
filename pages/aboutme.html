        <h5>Who I am</h5>
        <p>Currently situated in Toronto, I am a Cognitive Science and Psychology student aspiring to become a UX Designer.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Why UX</h5>
        <p>It just seemed right. As an individual who is motivated by psychology, passionate about people, and naturally curious about tech and visual design, the UI/UX world just seemed like a natural fit.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>What UX means to me</h5>
        <p>I remember sitting in my Psychology classes, wondering how I could better the lives of others using these ideas that were backed by research. To me, UX embodies this principle. Every decision that is made, is made with the people that it is for in mind.</p>

        <h3>My story thus far</h3>
        <p>I started my journey in Computer Science and Cognitive Science, then I moved towards Psychology as my interest in that topic grew. I arrived at UI/UX as I realized it captured everything that I was passionate about, and thus was where I wanted to be. Though the path was long (and somewhat stressful), I learned a lot from these different industries, including both soft and hard skills, as well as the many exciting projects and talented people I've met along the way!
